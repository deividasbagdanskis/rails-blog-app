  text: "Criminals have gotten more and more clever when it comes to their
    ability to track and hack.\n\nBut it isn’t just criminals you have to worry
     about. Sure, they can use cookies and pixels and other tools to track your
     online movements looking for a weakness or for you to make a mistake and
    expose yourself (like clicking a phishing link), but what about marketers,
    governments, and even your own internet service provider? How do you hide
    your information and online presence from your own internet company?\n\n
    Let’s look at a few ways that you can protect your identity and secure your
     online transactions.\n\nTor Browser\n\nTor is one of the easiest ways to
    protect yourself online. Just like you can use Google to download Mozilla
    Firefox or Opera, you can search ‘download Tor’ and safely add the browser
    to your desktop.\n\nBut what is Tor?\n\nThe Tor project, originally called
    The Onion Router, is open-source software that enables anonymous online
    communication. If you’re reading this and thinking some slightly nefarious
    thoughts about hacking your school’s computers to change your grades or
    hacking your office to play a prank … it is not that secure—at least not
    in its basic stock form. That said, you can adjust your Tor settings, run
    it off a segmented virtual machine, and then couple it with VPNs, and
    you’ll be safe against marketers, criminals, and even your own ISP!\n\n
    How does it work?\n\nIt’s like an onion. Hence, The Onion Router. It has
    nested application layers that are encrypted (like an onion). Basically,
    Tor encrypts your data and the IP address multiple times and sends it
    through a series of random Tor relays. The relays each decipher a piece of
    the encryption before passing it on to the next relay for further
    decoding. This makes it extremely difficult for any network surveillance
    to determine the source and destination.\n\nBitCoin\n\nYou may be
    wondering why Bitcoin will secure your transactions and protect your
    identity. Well, just as we stated above, marketers sometimes sell info.
    But often, it’s not even them. Even though they have taken steps to secure
    your information against criminals, the internet service provider may be
    looking over their shoulders. If you are using Tor browser and handle your
    purchases in BTC, it’s nearly impossible for an opportunistic hack or
    identity theft to occur.\n\nBitcoin is not nearly as anonymous as people
    once thought; you have to purchase it after all. But you can look at it
    similarly to replacing all of that information you fill out when making an
    online purchase, bank card number, billing address, name, etc. with just
    an email address. With BTC, the blockchain verifies the transaction, so
    you don’t need to go through the normal, archaic process of verifying your
    identity with banks talking back and forth to one another. If the website
    you are purchasing from does end up getting scraped for information, the
    most potential criminals will get your BTC address. They can’t do much with
    it … it’s like someone having your email address, but much more secure.
    The most they can do is send funds to your address, which wouldn’t be too
    bad!\n\nBitcoin is used by many online outlets due to Standard wire
    transfers and foreign purchases typically involve fees and exchange costs.
    Since bitcoin transactions have no intermediary institutions or government
    involvement, in terms of the costs of transacting are kept very low. This
    can be a major advantage for travelers, also in terms of accessibility
    users are able to send and receive bitcoins with only a smartphone or
    computer, making it very attractive to many types of industries like
    Microsoft, AT&T, Fast Food chain restaurants, Airlines, the gambling
    industry, Gift card online retailers even Amazon (though not directly).\n\n
    Orchid\n\nOrchid is a great way to secure your online activities while on
    your mobile devices. It’s a crypto-powered VPN that operates on the
    Ethereum network. You can use ETH to buy a few Orchid, which is used to
    purchase affordable prepaid VPN services throughout the Orchid VPN app.
    The coolest part is that you have complete control, and there is no
    singular VPN provider—like when you buy a monthly service
    subscription—that could in turn and sell your information.\n\nEssentially,
    you log on to Orchid, and it searches for the most viable bandwidth and
    rents it for you so that your sessions are split between different
    providers. You can even choose multiple VPNs so that Orchid periodically
    jumps from one provider to the next, so no singular service has the entire
    picture of your online activities."
